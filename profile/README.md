welcome to vietfood üçú  
we cook code like street food ‚Äî fast, cheap, sometimes messy, but tasty  

- inspired by [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad) and Karpathy's philosophy, we build small but meaningful projects for community  
- learn by breaking stuff, fix it later (maybe)

what we care about:  
- low-level and high performance programming (gpu). efficient LLM (inference and training)
- safety of AI model. mechanistic interpretability of LLM
- reinforcement learning

our philosophy:
- teaching through code: we prefer tiny, readable implementations over giant frameworks
- open source, open learning, open mistakes (we learn in public, even when it's messy)
- teaching by chaos (read the code, cry a little, then understand)

some of our projects:
- [cs4all-vn](https://github.com/vietfood/cs4all-vn): a tiny wiki about computer science for vietnamese students and practitioners. we're actively writing the best articles we can. right now we have notes (and some solved exercises) for [PRML](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf) (Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book by Bishop).  
- [gemm-metal](https://github.com/vietfood/gemm_metal): a tiny project on how to write [GEMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms#Level_3) kernels in Metal (Apple).
- [mlp.c](https://github.com/vietfood/mlp.c): a tiny project on speedrun MLP trainer from scratch (CUDA) and compare with Pytorch version. This project is on active development.
- [lazy-unlearner](https://github.com/vietfood/lazy-unlearner): a tiny research projects on the effect of RMU (Representation Misdirection Unlearning) on LLM unlearning and how to fix it with mechanistic interpretability.
