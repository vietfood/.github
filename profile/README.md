welcome to vietfood üçú
a tiny kitchen where we cook up code for the community

- we're a tiny group of vietnamese students
- inspired by [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad), we build small but meaningful projects for our community
- we learn by doing, and share what we learn

some of our projects:
- [cs4all-vn](https://github.com/vietfood/cs4all-vn): a tiny wiki about computer science for vietnamese students and practitioners. we're actively writing the best articles we can. right now we have notes (and some solved exercises) for [prml](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf) (pattern recognition and machine learning book by Bishop).
- [gemm-metal](https://github.com/vietfood/gemm_metal): a tiny project to teach students and practitioners how to write [gemm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms#Level_3) kernels in metal (apple) and cuda (nvidia). this project isn't finished yet, we will complete it as soon as possible.
- [banhxeo](https://github.com/vietfood/banhxeo/tree/main): a tiny nlp framework written in jax/flax to teach how llms and nlp models are implemented. we plan to rewrite this later to be smaller, less ambitious, and focused only on llms.
