welcome to vietfood üçú  
we cook code like street food ‚Äî fast, cheap, sometimes messy, but tasty  

- we're a bunch of Viet students hacking on CS/AI
- inspired by [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad), we build small but meaningful projects for our community  
- learn by breaking stuff, fix it later (maybe)

what we care about:  
- low-level and high performance programming (gpu, simd). efficient LLM/AI (flashattention, etc.)
- teaching through code: we prefer tiny, readable implementations over giant frameworks
- making CS/AI knowledge accessible for vietnamese students & practitioners
- open source, open learning, open mistakes (we learn in public, even when it's messy)
- teaching by chaos (read the code, cry a little, then understand)

some of our projects:  
- [cs4all-vn](https://github.com/vietfood/cs4all-vn): a tiny wiki about computer science for vietnamese students and practitioners. we're actively writing the best articles we can. right now we have notes (and some solved exercises) for [PRML](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf) (Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book by Bishop).  
- [gemm-metal](https://github.com/vietfood/gemm_metal): a tiny project to teach students and practitioners how to write [GEMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms#Level_3) kernels in Metal (Apple) (and maybe CUDA ?). this project isn't finished yet, we will complete it as soon as possible.
