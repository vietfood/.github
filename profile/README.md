- we want to create something meaningful for commnuity

some projects of us:
- [cs4all-vn](https://github.com/vietfood/cs4all-vn): a tiny wiki about computer science for Vietnamse student and practioner. We're actively writing best articles we can. Currently, we have [PRML](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf) (Pattern Recognitiona and Machine Learning) note (and some exercises also have been solved).
